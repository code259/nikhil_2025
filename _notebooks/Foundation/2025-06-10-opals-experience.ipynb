    "# From Microscopes to Models: My Research Journey with OPAls\n",
    "\n",
    "During my time with **OPAls**, I had the privilege of working on a project that combined biology, image analysis, and automation. Our primary focus was on analyzing **rat kangaroo cells** to identify **UFBs (Ultra-Fine Bridges)** ‚Äî tiny DNA threads that may have major implications in cancer biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "What began as microscopy work evolved into an engineering problem ‚Äî one that taught me **resilience, adaptability, and the power of iteration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß¨ Understanding UFBs\n",
    "\n",
    "**UFBs (Ultra-Fine Bridges)** are thin DNA structures that appear during cell division (particularly in **anaphase**). They are not coated with histones, making them difficult to visualize and distinguish from other structures like **tethers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do they matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "- UFBs are often found in **stressed cells**, which mimic the environment of **cancerous cells**.\n",
    "- They may be **biomarkers of genomic instability**, and studying them could deepen our understanding of how cancer develops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to provide strong, consistent evidence that **differentiates UFBs from tethers** using image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ Experimental Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We worked with **rat kangaroo (PtK2) cells**, which have large, easily observable chromosomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stressors used:**\n",
    "- `Aphidicolin`: Induces replication stress by inhibiting DNA polymerase.\n",
    "- `Colcemid`: Disrupts microtubules, interfering with mitosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stains applied:**\n",
    "- `PICH`: Labels UFBs.\n",
    "- `DAPI`: Stains all DNA in the nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "After stress exposure, cells were **fixed and stained**, then imaged using high-resolution microscopy. We collected **over 800 images** across multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† The Challenge: Manual Image Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image had to be analyzed through multiple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the cell phase**, focusing only on **anaphase**.\n",
    "2. **Apply thresholding** to isolate stained regions.\n",
    "3. **Manually select** cells and bridges.\n",
    "4. **Measure** features like bridge length, intensity, and cell shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we faced several problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some images were **blurry** or hard to interpret.\n",
    "- **Incorrect phase identification** led to wasted analysis.\n",
    "- The **volume** of data was overwhelming.\n",
    "- **Manual errors** introduced inconsistencies and slowed progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è My Solution: Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "I realized this manual workflow wasn‚Äôt scalable, so I decided to **automate the process**. I developed a custom script that handled the entire pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ Features of the Automation System\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase filtering**: Detected and focused on anaphase cells using morphological features.\n",
    "- **Thresholding and watershed segmentation**: Isolated cells and bridges.\n",
    "- **Automated selection**: Identified UFB-like structures based on geometry and intensity.\n",
    "- **Measurement extraction**: Collected area, intensity, length, and position data.\n",
    "- **Batch processing**: Ran across hundreds of images efficiently.\n",
    "- **Visualization tools**: Output charts and tables summarizing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "What started as a semi-automated system with **human validation at each step** became a **fully autonomous pipeline** after several iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÅ Iteration with Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the process, I worked closely with my advisor, **Dr. Veronica Gomez**, who guided improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- She emphasized **batch processing**, which led me to optimize image I/O and memory usage.\n",
    "- We iterated on **cell segmentation quality**, reducing edge-case errors.\n",
    "- Her feedback helped me make the tool more **robust and user-friendly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This back-and-forth taught me the **value of scientific communication**, even when the solution is technical.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß∞ What I Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "This project helped me develop and strengthen several skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Solving**: I recognized a bottleneck and took initiative to fix it.\n",
    "- **Scientific Communication**: I explained technical decisions and data clearly to my biology-focused team.\n",
    "- **Software Engineering**: I built, tested, and iterated on a real-world automation tool.\n",
    "- **Resilience**: I faced errors, false starts, and late nights, but kept improving the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, I learned how **biology and computation can come together** to enable deeper insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìà Potential Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our project concluded with strong results, here were some potential extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **machine learning** to classify cell phases or identify UFBs.\n",
    "- Apply the workflow to **other cell types** or biological structures.\n",
    "- Expand analysis to include **more advanced statistical comparisons** across conditions.\n",
