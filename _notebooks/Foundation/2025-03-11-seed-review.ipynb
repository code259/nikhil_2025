    "- Q11 Color represented by binary triplet: Did the binary to base 10 conversion of the RGB triplet given wrong (11111111, 11111111, 11110000), I approximated  the final number instead of calcuating it which was a mistake.\n",
    "- Q15 Compare output of program a and b: While half of my logic was correct (i.e the part that identified both programs have same number of entires), I thought they have different values when they didn't. Going through a few concrete examples for each algorithm would be a useful tool in future problems.\n",
    "- Q18 Algorithm to move robot to goal: Didn't read the question correctly, I thought that the black section was a walll rather than something that termiantes the robot.\n",
    "- Q27 Existence of unsolvable problems: Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles roughly every two years, and this improves performance thus by this observation performance is not a problem. Rather it is the lack of algorithms to solve certain complex problems, although some optimization problems are limited by classical computer's efficiency and provide a premise and usecase for quantum computing in the future. The algorithm option is the better answer despite the other option choice holding true in some cases.\n",
    "- Q40 Role of certificate authorities: Didn't know that a certificate authority verifies the authenticity of encryption keys used in secured communications.\n",
    "- Q50 Reasonable time algorithms: I knew that 1 and 3 were reasonable time but wasn't sure if n^2 was considered reasnonable time for a large n, thus choose the last one despite it not making complete sense. Will employ process of elimination in the future in the future, and will consider n^2 as reasonable run time.\n",
    "- Q66 Error in counting perfect numbers: Logical mistake - didn't read the purpose of the algorithm correctly and thus got wrong answer.\n",
    "- Q67 Error in numOccurrences procedure: Didn't understand the question and what it was asking for, moreover the purpose of the algorithm and its function was confusing for this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement**\n",
    "- 4 question improvement upon last time, which shows improvement and developement of core skills.\n",
    "- Compared to last time got the questions about encryption and got a 100% on the network section of the test, which is an improvement compared to last time. Moreover, I had a five question improvement upon last time.\n",
    "- However I still need to focus on maintaing focus on the test and reading all the questions carefully even towards the end of the examination, also it seems I need to focus on **safe computing** and **algorithmic error**\n"

Then a call to algorithm is made, where the DELETE algorithm is ran on the backend when the fetch request was made to the /api/pgn endpoint with the proper method and body data allowing for the backend to be updated after which the frontend is subsequently updated with another fetchGames function call.\n",

    "- The *sequencing* of the function call is as follows, first a fetch is made to the /api/pgns endpoint which is a BULK CRUD endpoint that returns all the chess game entries from the PGN table of the database as a json object. The forEach loop then performs *iteration* and goes through the list to then utlize the DOM (document object model) and create a card with numerous elements in it: a H3, H4, buttons with event listeners, and p tags. This code is all wrapped in a try-catch statement for error handling within the application, which shows the *selection* as try-except loops are are considered selection for they are a form of conditional that checks for errors. Moreover, there is other error handling that checks whether the response is acceptable before continuing, else an error is thrown.\n",

    "            return jsonify(json_ready)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- This python function for my games REST API queries the pgn table of the SQLite3 database, to return all the games which it does then stores in the list *pgns*, each pgn is then processed as the read method of the pgn object is ran, and the output is saved in the json_ready list which is returned by the function in a json format.\n",

    "                json_ready.append(pgn_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- This code block creates a new list called json_ready, the for loop then uses *iteration* to loop through the pgns list, and then perform the read method of the pgn object, save that in a variable called pgn_data then append it to the json_ready list. This could be done using list comprehension, but I wrote it in a traditional for loop so I could perform debugging when an issue occured.\n",
