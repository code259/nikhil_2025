    "- **Score: 59/67**\n",
    "- Q11 Color represented by binary triplet: Did the binary to base 10 conversion of the RGB triplet given wrong (11111111, 11111111, 11110000), I approximated  the final number instead of calcuating it which was a mistake.\n",
    "- Q15 Compare output of program a and b: While half of my logic was correct (i.e the part that identified both programs have same number of entires), I thought they have different values when they didn't. Going through a few concrete examples for each algorithm would be a useful tool in future problems.\n",
    "- Q18 Algorithm to move robot to goal: Didn't read the question correctly, I thought that the black section was a walll rather than something that termiantes the robot.\n",
    "- Q27 Existence of unsolvable problems: Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles roughly every two years, and this improves performance thus by this observation performance is not a problem. Rather it is the lack of algorithms to solve certain complex problems, although some optimization problems are limited by classical computer's efficiency and provide a premise and usecase for quantum computing in the future. The algorithm option is the better answer despite the other option choice holding true in some cases.\n",
    "- Q40 Role of certificate authorities: Didn't know that a certificate authority verifies the authenticity of encryption keys used in secured communications.\n",
    "- Q50 Reasonable time algorithms: I knew that 1 and 3 were reasonable time but wasn't sure if n^2 was considered reasnonable time for a large n, thus choose the last one despite it not making complete sense. Will employ process of elimination in the future in the future, and will consider n^2 as reasonable run time.\n",
    "- Q66 Error in counting perfect numbers: Logical mistake - didn't read the purpose of the algorithm correctly and thus got wrong answer.\n",
    "- Q67 Error in numOccurrences procedure: Didn't understand the question and what it was asking for, moreover the purpose of the algorithm and its function was confusing for this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement**\n",
    "- 4 question improvement upon last time, which shows improvement and developement of core skills.\n",
    "- Compared to last time got the questions about encryption and got a 100% on the network section of the test, which is an improvement compared to last time. Moreover, I had a five question improvement upon last time.\n",
    "- However I still need to focus on maintaing focus on the test and reading all the questions carefully even towards the end of the examination, also it seems I need to focus on **safe computing** and **algorithmic error**\n"

    "Debugging Stockfish API Integration:\n",
    "- Ensured proper communication between frontend and backend by resolving issues with API responses and parsing, had to make a converter to shift between various chess formats.\n",
    "- Identified and fixed analysis API where the engine would return unexpected or invalid evaluation with proper conditional checking.\n",
    "Fixing Deployment Issues:\n",
    "- Resolved CORS errors by updating Nginx configuration and ensuring proper request handling.\n",
    "- Addressed database initialization failures that prevented proper game state storage.\n",
    "- Debugged server-side API failures caused by outdated pythonURI and misconfigured fetch functions.\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/postman.png\">\n",
    "**BI 2** (Data)-\n",
    "Game State Management:\n",
    "- Developed a database schema to store user-specific game history, moves, and evaluations.\n",
    "- Implemented CRUD operations for users to create, update, and review past games.\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/database.png\">\n",
    "Stockfish Evaluation Data:\n",
    "- Designed API endpoints to fetch move evaluations and best move suggestions from Stockfish.\n",
    "- Processed and formatted evaluation scores to make them user-friendly (e.g., centipawn advantage, mate threats).\n",
    "Data Persistence and Retrieval:\n",
    "- Optimized database queries for retrieving and storing large amounts of move data efficiently.\n",
    "- Ensured data integrity by handling concurrency issues when multiple users accessed game history simultaneously.\n",
    "**BI 4** (Deployment)\n",
    "Server Setup & Hosting:\n",
    "Managed environment variables to ensure secure and scalable deployment.\n",
    "Handling Production Issues:\n",
    "- Resolved an outdated Nginx issue that caused CORS errors preventing API communication.\n",
    "- Debugged database initialization failures that blocked game data from being created correctly.\n"
