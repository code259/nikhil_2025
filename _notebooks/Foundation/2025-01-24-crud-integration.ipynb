    "### CRUD Integration Checkpoint (01/27/2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executive Summary:**\n",
    "- Made a database to store user chess games and the moves played in the form of PGN files.\n",
    "- Created a REST api with POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE requests to manipulate data.\n",
    "- Created manager page on frontend to review, delete, and update games.\n",
    "- Created function request to save games automatically after completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Purpose:**\n",
    "- Chess social platform to discuss, analyze and learn chess content. Our project will be a social media website and forum where users can discuss chess topics and interact with Artificial Intelligence to learn and play chess.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Individual Features:**\n",
    "- The purpose of my feature for this review is to store games the user plays against the computer, this enables future review and analysis using the analysis page. The manager page employs CRUD functions so the user can manage the data.\n",
    "- The game feature enables the user to play chess and provide data and topics of discussion for the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input/Output requests:**\n",
    "- The PGN API has GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. The GET request is seen in the manager when the page is loaded as all the games are populated in cards, the POST request is made on the game page immediately after the game is over. The PATCH request is used to update the database entries, a PATCH request is used instead of a PUT as a PUT typically means all fields are changed, but for my data that would be illogical do I developed a PATCH method instead. Lastly, the DELETE request can also be used from the manager page. (to be shown in the live demo)\n",
