    "### CRUD Integration Checkpoint (01/27/2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executive Summary:**\n",
    "- Made a database to store user chess games and the moves played in the form of PGN files.\n",
    "- Created a REST api with POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE requests to manipulate data.\n",
    "- Created manager page on frontend to review, delete, and update games.\n",
    "- Created function request to save games automatically after completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Purpose:**\n",
    "- Chess social platform to discuss, analyze and learn chess content. Our project will be a social media website and forum where users can discuss chess topics and interact with Artificial Intelligence to learn and play chess.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Individual Features:**\n",
    "- The purpose of my feature for this review is to store games the user plays against the computer, this enables future review and analysis using the analysis page. The manager page employs CRUD functions so the user can manage the data.\n",
    "- The game feature enables the user to play chess and provide data and topics of discussion for the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input/Output requests:**\n",
    "- The PGN API has GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. The GET request is seen in the manager when the page is loaded as all the games are populated in cards, the POST request is made on the game page immediately after the game is over. The PATCH request is used to update the database entries, a PATCH request is used instead of a PUT as a PUT typically means all fields are changed, but for my data that would be illogical do I developed a PATCH method instead. Lastly, the DELETE request can also be used from the manager page. (to be shown in the live demo)\n",

    "# CRUD Integration Checkpoint (01/27/2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary:\n",
    "Developed a system for users to track and manage their skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Team Purpose:\n",
    "Our project provides a social platform for users to track and improve their skills, manage profiles, and track progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Individual Features:\n",
    "For this review, I focused on the skills feature, where users can input, track, update, and delete their skills. This feature is essential for users to document and modify their skill sets easily, with functionality including creating new skills, updating skill details, and deleting skills they no longer wish to track. The frontend allows users to interact with this system through forms and buttons for the CRUD operations, while the backend stores and processes all data for persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input/Output requests:\n",
    "The Skills API supports the basic CRUD operations:  \n",
    "- **GET:** Retrieves a list of all skills or a specific skill by ID. This request is handled when the page loads or when a user requests a specific skill.\n",
    "- **POST:** Allows users to add new skills to the database. This is done through the form on the frontend, where the user submits the skill name, skill level, and user ID.\n",
    "- **PUT:** Enables users to update existing skills. If a user wishes to update their skill name or skill level, they can modify it using the “Update” button, which sends a PUT request to the API.\n",
    "- **DELETE:** Removes a specific skill from the database. The user can delete a skill by clicking the “Delete” button next to the corresponding entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests are handled by Flask_SQLAlchemy, which uses an ORM to manage the interaction with the database, allowing easy retrieval and manipulation of skill data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requests & DOM:\n",
    "The fetch requests interact with the backend API using the `POST`, `PUT`, `GET`, and `DELETE` methods. After fetching data from the API, the frontend dynamically populates a table to display the skill data. This table allows the user to view and interact with each entry, using buttons for adding, updating, and deleting skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database operations are managed by SQLAlchemy in the backend, which abstracts the SQL queries and simplifies working with the data.

    "## Executive Summary:\n",
    "For this sprint, I developed a full-stack feature that stores, manages, and analyzes chess moves and their evaluations. I created a backend database to store chess moves, built a RESTful API for CRUD operations, and integrated the backend with a frontend interface. Users can interact with this feature on the analysis page, where they can view, add, update, and delete chess moves dynamically.\n",
    "## Team Purpose:\n",
    "Our team is working on a chess-based social media platform where users can discuss chess strategies, analyze their games, and learn from others. My feature complements this vision by providing users with the tools to analyze their games, save key moves, and review them later for improvement and discussion.\n",
    "## Individual Feature:\n",
    "My feature focuses on enabling users to store and manage their chess moves and evaluations. Users can upload PGN files to analyze moves and save these moves to a database for later use. The manager page lets users perform CRUD operations, providing full control over their stored data. This feature enhances the user experience by allowing in-depth review and customization of their chess gameplay data.\n",
    "Key functionalities include:\n",
    "- **POST:** Adds a new evaluation to the database with the move number, move, and evaluation score.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def post(self):\n",

    "        return {'message': 'Move data is required.'}, 400\n",
    "    evaluation = Evaluation(\n",
    "        evaluation=data.get('evaluation'),\n",
    "        move=data.get('move'),\n",
    "        move_number=data.get('move_number')\n",

    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        return {'message': f'Error saving evaluation: {e}'}, 500\n",
    " ```\n",
    "- **GET:** Displays all saved moves in a dynamic table on the analysis page.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get(self):\n",
    "    all_evaluations = Evaluation.query.all()\n",
    "    return jsonify([evaluation.read() for evaluation in all_evaluations])\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **PUT:** Updates the evaluation or status of a move (e.g., marking it as \"played\").\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def put(self):\n",
    "    data = request.get_json()\n",
    "    if not data or 'id' not in data:\n",
    "        return {'message': 'ID is required to update the evaluation'}, 400\n",
    "    evaluation = Evaluation.query.get(data['id'])\n",
    "    if not evaluation:\n",
    "        return {'message': 'Evaluation not found'}, 404\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        evaluation.update(data)\n",
    "        return jsonify(evaluation.read())\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        return {'message': f'Error updating evaluation: {e}'}, 500\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **DELETE:** Removes moves from the database when no longer needed.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def delete(self):\n",
    "    data = request.get_json()\n",
    "    if not data or 'id' not in data:\n",
    "        return {'message': 'ID is required for deletion'}, 400\n",
    "    evaluation = Evaluation.query.get(data['id'])\n",
    "    if not evaluation:\n",

    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        return {'message': f'Error deleting evaluation: {e}'}, 500\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Input/Output Requests:\n",
    "The evaluation API supports all CRUD operations:\n",
    "1. **GET:** The analysis page fetches all moves from the backend and displays them in a table dynamically.\n",
    "2. **POST:** A POST request is triggered when a game is completed, saving new moves and their evaluations to the database.\n",
    "3. **PUT:** Users can update the status of a move, such as marking it as \"played,\" which sends a PUT request to the API.\n",
    "4. **DELETE:** A DELETE request is made when a user removes a move using the \"Remove\" button.\n",
    "These requests have been tested thoroughly using Postman to ensure correct functionality. Error handling ensures proper HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found) are returned for each request.\n",
    "## Requests & DOM Integration:\n",
    "Fetch requests on the frontend dynamically interact with the REST API:\n",
    "- **GET Requests:** Populate the DOM by fetching data from the backend and rendering it in a table. Loops are used to iterate through the response data, creating rows dynamically.\n",
    "- **POST Requests:** Send new move data to the backend when a game concludes, and update the DOM to reflect the added move.\n",
    "- **PUT Requests:** Allow users to edit move details, such as changing the evaluation or marking a move as \"played.\"\n",
    "- **DELETE Requests:** Dynamically remove moves from the database and the DOM.\n",
    "The backend uses Flask_SQLAlchemy as an ORM to manage database queries, abstracting SQL operations for ease of development.\n",
    "## Algorithmic Requests:\n",
    "My `_CRUD` class in the backend API handles POST, PUT, and DELETE requests:\n",
    "- The **POST method** takes move data from the frontend, validates it, and adds it to the database. Duplicate checks ensure data integrity.\n",
    "- The **PUT method** allows partial updates to entries, such as changing the evaluation or marking a move as \"played.\"\n",
    "- The **DELETE method** removes a move from the database based on its unique ID, returning an appropriate success or error message.\n",
    "Each method parses incoming request data, performs validation, interacts with the database, and returns a JSON response with a status code.\n",
    "## Call to Algorithm Requests:\n",
    "Frontend JavaScript functions handle the integration of the REST API with the UI:\n",
    "- A **POST request** is triggered when the user adds a move played in the game according to provided pgn file.\n",
    "- **GET requests** populate the moves table on page load, displaying all saved moves.\n",
    "- **PUT requests** allow users to mark moves as \"played\" or update their evaluations. These changes are reflected immediately in the DOM.\n",
    "- **DELETE requests** remove moves from the database and dynamically update the table to reflect the changes.\n",
    "For example, the \"Mark as Played\" button sends a PUT request to the API. Once the request is successful, the move is added to the \"Played Moves\" list and removed from the available moves table.\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "This feature provided valuable experience in building and integrating a full-stack application:\n",
    "- **Backend:** Developed a RESTful API with robust CRUD operations and integrated it with a database.\n",
    "- **Frontend:** Designed a dynamic interface that allows users to manage their chess gameplay data effectively.\n",
    "- **Testing:** Used Postman for testing API endpoints and ensured smooth interaction between the backend and frontend.\n",
    "This project helped me better understand the complexities of full-stack development, especially in managing state and ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend. I'm excited to refine and expand this feature in future sprints"
