    "# OCS Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recent Crossover Review: https://github.com/illuminati1618/pages-databaseguys-sprint4/issues/68#issue-3848734551\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Admin Table (Grade API Complete Refactor and Overhaul)**\n",
    "  I led a major refactor of the Grade API and rebuilt the admin table to be more scalable, secure, and actually usable long-term. This included adding in-table PDF viewing, PNG viewing with in-window download support, filtering and sorting tools, and stronger admin authentication/security checks. The system is now stable enough that other teams are actively building on top of it (rubrics, aggregation, lesson integration, etc.). More importantly, this work laid the foundation for grade aggregation across lessons and homework, making it a core backend + frontend component of OCS rather than a one-off admin tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layout System / Learning Experience Design (LxD)**\n",
    "  I helped design and implement the new OCS layout system as part of the platform redesign. The course view, including the two-pane layout, was built intentionally using learning experience design principles (such as Merrill’s principles) rather than just visual preference. This structure is now the backbone of how students actually interact with courses on OCS. In addition to design work, I also contributed to smaller but important programming pieces that made the layout functional and reusable. Overall, this became a foundational system that future OCS courses are built on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Upload System (Cross-Platform, Multi-Iteration)**\n",
    "  I built and iterated on the file upload system multiple times (around 4–5 major iterations), focusing on flexibility and future reuse. This included creating a v1 file upload system in Flask that later students can directly reuse in their own APIs, as well as multiple Spring Boot implementations backed by both local storage and S3. I eventually generalized this into a broader Spring S3 API meant for long-term use across OCS. This work is foundational for future data capture, personalization, and analytics, especially as OCS expands toward more student-specific insights and features discussed by Mort.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Emotion API (Cross-Class Collaboration Project)**\n",
    "  I created a secure Emotion API as a passion project that built on ideas originally explored by CSP students. After talking with Nithika and reviewing their work, I designed and implemented the backend AI system to support emotion detection in a clean, secure way. The API is documented separately and can now be used for group features, interactive projects, or future experiments on OCS. This project is a good example of cross-class collaboration, where earlier student work inspired a more advanced, production-ready backend system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Teamwork and Helping the Community**\n",
    "  Beyond core engineering work, I consistently helped other students and teams by building lessons and games for younger students, assisting during office hours, and unblocking teammates when they were stuck. I focused on making concepts more understandable rather than just giving answers, which helped others move faster and build confidence. This support work made team collaboration smoother and contributed to a stronger overall learning environment."

    "### Frontend\n",
    "- **Redundancy:** There is significant redundancy in the SCSS and CSS across the site. Many `.md` files and isolated pages have their own custom CSS written by different contributors, which leads to overlapping styles, duplicated rules, and general bloating. While there have been attempts at theming, the theme does not propagate cleanly across all pages, so the visual experience often feels inconsistent and fragmented.\n",
    "- **Modularity:** The frontend lacks strong modularity in its components. Common UI elements such as buttons, icons, dropdowns, cards, and layouts are frequently reimplemented instead of reused. This makes the design harder to maintain and causes inconsistencies in spacing, colors, and interactions.\n",
    "- **Consistent Style:** Adopting a shared component or style library (similar to how Tailwind CSS encourages reusable components and utilities) could help enforce a consistent design language, reduce repeated work, and make it easier for contributors to follow a clear structure when building new pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backend\n",
    "- **Data Capture:** Data capture is limited across the platform. There is an opportunity to collect more meaningful analytics from FRQs, homework, and lessons, such as reading time, completion patterns, retries, and common error points. With the existing S3 API, file uploads and related metadata could also be integrated more tightly, allowing data capture beyond the current local file-based system. Given that S3 storage is relatively inexpensive, this approach is more scalable and realistic long-term.\n",
    "- **Communication:** Communication tools are present but difficult to use effectively. While microblogs exist, they feel rudimentary and lack the ease of use, organization, and responsiveness found in tools like Slack. This makes collaboration and discussion less natural than it could be.\n",
    "- **Personalization:** The platform lacks strong individualized learning support. While OCS is a powerful and useful tool, most content is broad and generalized rather than tailored to individual users. With better data capture, the system could adapt content, pacing, and practice to each student. This individualization could be informed by established learning frameworks, such as Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction, by identifying prior knowledge, emphasizing application over passive reading, providing targeted practice, and reinforcing integration through personalized feedback and follow-up activities."
