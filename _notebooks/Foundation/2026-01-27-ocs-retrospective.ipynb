    "* **Improved Java Knowledge (Backend):**\n",
    "  * Learned to use Java with Spring Boot to build and manage backend APIs.\n",
    "  * Created POJOs, schemas, and database tables (e.g., user progress, grades).\n",
    "  * Understood Spring’s exception handling and Java’s static typing error patterns.\n",
    "  * Gained experience debugging backend logic and data flow between API and database.\n",
    "  * Improved understanding of REST structure and general backend design principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved Frontend Knowledge (Frontend):**\n",
    "  * Learned how to approach more modular frontend design, especially when working with others on shared layout and UI components for OCS.\n",
    "  * Gained experience using layouts more effectively to avoid repeating the same structure across multiple pages.\n",
    "  * Better understanding of the GitHub Pages toolset and how static site constraints affect design decisions.\n",
    "  * Learned how to handle larger frontend refactors without breaking existing pages by making incremental, testable changes.\n",
    "  * Improved skills in debugging frontend issues, including layout bugs, styling conflicts, and broken links.\n",
    "  * Became more comfortable tracing bugs across HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript instead of treating them as isolated problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Soft Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved Agile/Scrum Skills:**\n",
    "  * Gained deeper understanding of team-based Git workflows (forks, PRs, branching).\n",
    "  * Learned how to create clean, non-breaking PRs with readable, modular changes.\n",
    "  * Tested teammates’ PRs using `git checkout`, ensuring functionality before merges.\n",
    "  * Improved at code reviews by identifying logical errors, style issues, and better implementation approaches.\n",
    "  * Developed a stronger overall grasp of collaborative development and version control discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Communication:**\n",
    "  * Learned how to communicate clearly in a larger team setting (12+ people), which required more structure and accountability.\n",
    "  * Improved at meeting deadlines as part of a large team by coordinating tasks and understanding dependencies between people’s work.\n",
    "  * Became more comfortable asking teammates for help or clarification when stuck, instead of blocking progress by working in isolation.\n",
    "  * Used tools like VS Code Live Share to collaborate in real time on debugging and implementation.\n",
    "  * Gained experience using Slack and other messaging platforms to share updates, ask questions, and resolve issues quickly.\n",
    "  * Improved at giving and receiving feedback in a constructive way, especially during PR reviews and planning discussions.\n"
