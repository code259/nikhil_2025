    "### Frontend\n",
    "- **Redundancy:** There is significant redundancy in the SCSS and CSS across the site. Many `.md` files and isolated pages have their own custom CSS written by different contributors, which leads to overlapping styles, duplicated rules, and general bloating. While there have been attempts at theming, the theme does not propagate cleanly across all pages, so the visual experience often feels inconsistent and fragmented.\n",
    "- **Modularity:** The frontend lacks strong modularity in its components. Common UI elements such as buttons, icons, dropdowns, cards, and layouts are frequently reimplemented instead of reused. This makes the design harder to maintain and causes inconsistencies in spacing, colors, and interactions.\n",
    "- **Consistent Style:** Adopting a shared component or style library (similar to how Tailwind CSS encourages reusable components and utilities) could help enforce a consistent design language, reduce repeated work, and make it easier for contributors to follow a clear structure when building new pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backend\n",
    "- **Data Capture:** Data capture is limited across the platform. There is an opportunity to collect more meaningful analytics from FRQs, homework, and lessons, such as reading time, completion patterns, retries, and common error points. With the existing S3 API, file uploads and related metadata could also be integrated more tightly, allowing data capture beyond the current local file-based system. Given that S3 storage is relatively inexpensive, this approach is more scalable and realistic long-term.\n",
    "- **Communication:** Communication tools are present but difficult to use effectively. While microblogs exist, they feel rudimentary and lack the ease of use, organization, and responsiveness found in tools like Slack. This makes collaboration and discussion less natural than it could be.\n",
    "- **Personalization:** The platform lacks strong individualized learning support. While OCS is a powerful and useful tool, most content is broad and generalized rather than tailored to individual users. With better data capture, the system could adapt content, pacing, and practice to each student. This individualization could be informed by established learning frameworks, such as Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction, by identifying prior knowledge, emphasizing application over passive reading, providing targeted practice, and reinforcing integration through personalized feedback and follow-up activities."
