    "- Comments: Got comments on how it was an interesting paradigm and methodology to be getting certificates and other tangibles in the classroom as a result of learning and how that is applicable to the real world where people are trying to get certified and learn skills. Many listeners thought it was interesting how we gave certificates for Linkedin. Beyond certificates many listeners mentioned being impressed by the backend work - the database storage - and technical concepts (CRUD, etc.) required to implement the system across the whole team.\n",
    "- Reflection: Thought it went well overall and I think as a team we did a good job presenting while abstracting the technical details for listeners until asked, and we were able to convey the purpose of our group and what we accomplished without incomprehensible language. However, that being said I think some more discussion of the technical details could have been interesting for the listener and maybe showcased the work we did better."

    "#### Corrections (top 5 questions):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3:** The original selection (B) was incorrect because the only available constructor in the Painting class is defined as public Painting(int y, String a), meaning it requires exactly two arguments: an integer for the year, followed by a String for the artist. Option (B), Painting p = new Painting(1939, \"Frida Kahlo\", \"Self Portrait\");, provides three arguments, which does not match the constructor's signature. The correct code segment is (D), which is Painting p = new Painting(1939, \"Frida Kahlo\");, as it correctly provides the two required arguments in the correct order: the integer 1939 followed by the string \"Frida Kahlo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 8:** The execution of the code segment double w = 2.0; double x = 5.0; double y = (int) w / x; double z = (int) (w / x); involves crucial rules of type casting and promotion in Java. The calculation for y is (int) w / x. Here, w (2.0) is cast to an integer, making it 2. The expression becomes 2 / x (or 2 / 5.0). Because an integer (2) is divided by a double (5.0), the integer is automatically promoted to a double (2.0), resulting in floating-point division: $2.0 / 5.0 = \\mathbf{0.4}$. The calculation for z is (int) (w / x). Here, the floating-point division w / x ($2.0 / 5.0$) is calculated first, resulting in 0.4. This result (0.4) is then explicitly cast to an integer, truncating the decimal part and yielding $\\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, the output System.out.println(y + \", \" + z); prints the values of y and z, which is 0.4, 0.0, making option (C) the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 9:** The original answer, which suggests the error is related to accessing the private variables feet and inches inside toInches(), is incorrect. Those variables are accessible because they are being used within their own class, Measurement. The actual compilation error occurs because the toInches() method itself is declared as private within the Measurement class. The compare method in the separate Calculations class attempts to call this method using m1.toInches() and m2.toInches(). Since the private access modifier restricts the method's use to the internal workings of the Measurement class only, it cannot be called from an external class like Calculations. Therefore, the correct explanation for the error is (C) The toInches method cannot be accessed from a class other than Measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 14:** The task is to find a boolean expression equivalent to the negation of a compound expression: !(isEven && isPositive) && isPrime. We can use De Morgan's Laws to simplify the inner negated term, !(isEven && isPositive). De Morgan's Law states that the negation of a conjunction (AND) is the disjunction (OR) of the negations: !(A && B) is equivalent to (!A || !B). Applying this to the inner part, we get (!isEven || !isPositive). Substituting this back into the original expression yields: (!isEven || !isPositive) && isPrime. The only option that matches this simplified and equivalent form is (A), which is (!isEven || !isPositive) && isPrime. The initial selection (C), which was (!isEven && !isPositive) && isPrime, is incorrect because it incorrectly applied De Morgan's Law using && instead of || for the disjunction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 28:** The provided Java code segment is designed to systematically analyze a string for consecutive, identical characters, thereby performing a crucial string manipulation task. The program initializes the string str as \"abbcdddeff\" and utilizes a while loop that iterates through the string, stopping just before the final character. Within the loop, the conditional statement employs the substring() and equals() methods to compare the character at the current index, $j$, with the character immediately following it at $j+1$. This precise comparison identifies instances of adjacency equality. By meticulously tracking the string from its genesis at index $0$ to its penultimate character at index $8$, we find four distinct occurrences where the characters are equivalent: 'b' at indices $1$ and $2$, 'd' at $4$ and $5$, 'd' at $5$ and $6$, and 'f' at $8$ and $9$. Consequently, the count variable is incremented four times, confirming that the program will print 4 upon execution."
