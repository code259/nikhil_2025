Proves that there's no general algorithm that can determine whether every possible program/input combination halts or not. More generally, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running."

    "A real-world example of using heuristics is Google Maps when it finds the fastest driving route. The app uses quick guesses based on traffic, road types, and speed limits to find a good path. It doesn’t check every possible route because there are too many combinations, which would take too long. Instead, it picks a route that’s probably the fastest, even if it’s not perfect. This helps people get directions quickly without waiting for a computer to try every option."
